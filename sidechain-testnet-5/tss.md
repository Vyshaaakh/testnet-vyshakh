# TSSigner

The *`TSS`*(**Threshold Signature Scheme**) network is a key building block intended to perform Bitcoin signing in the distributed manner to facilitate the Bitcoin bridge on the [Side Chain](https://github.com/sideprotocol/side)

The TSS signature network consists of twenty-one nodes which are a subset of the Side validators of well-known reputation.

TSS nodes are mainly responsible for several tasks: *`DKG`*(**Distributed Key Generation**), `Signing` and `Relaying`.

## DKG

The DKG procedure is as follows:

1. Initiate: The DKG initiation is proposed as a governance proposal on the Side chain. The proposal contains the DKG participant set and required  threshold for later signing.

2. Vote: Community members and validators can vote for the proposal.

3. Create: The DKG request is formally created on the Side chain when the proposal passed.

4. Complete: TSS nodes will coordinate to complete the DKG request. All participants listed in the proposal must be connected to the TSS network in the phase.

5. Re-DKG: This happen when some nodes want to quit the TSS network according to their operation demands. New signing keys will be generated by the steps above and all assets held by the previous keys will be transferred to the newly generated ones.

## Signing

Signing is the regular task for TSS nodes.

1. Signing requests are fetched from the Side chain by the TSS node periodically.

2. Sign the requests and broadcast the related messages when signing requests are received.

## Relaying

As the security guard, TSS nodes can contribute to the security of the bitcoin bridge by relaying the bitcoin block headers.

At the same time, the bridge related transactions including deposit and withdrawal can be relayed to the Side chain by TSS nodes as well.

## Get started

### Download the binary file

```
wget https://github.com/sideprotocol/testnet/raw/main/sidechain-testnet-5/shuttler -O ~/shuttler
chmod 777 shuttler
```

### Configure

#### 1. Initialize
```
shuttler --home ~/.shuttler init --network testnet
```

The *home* directory can be replaced by your choice.

You can specify the port by `--port`. The default port is `5158`.

#### 2. Set the bootstrapping nodes

```sh
vi ~/.shuttler/config.toml
bootstrap_nodes = ["<peer address>",...,"<peer address>"]
```

The bootstrapping nodes are used to help connect to the TSS network when started.
The format of the peer address is like this:
```
/ip4/<IP>/tcp/<PORT>/p2p/<PEER ID>
```

Your `peer id` can be retrieved as the following command:
```
shuttler --home <home> address
```
Please share your node address in the private channel so others can add you. and make sure to add at least 3 bootstrap nodes in your Shuttler config.

The seed node provided by Side Labs is as following:
```
/ip4/80.240.21.182/tcp/5158/p2p/12D3KooWNG62UtivnohfQkDUbXZXHD41sVnbpMSo3nJk9ipnhNE4
```

#### 3. Set the Side gRPC
```
[side_chain]
grpc = "<gprc address>"
```
If you run own Side node on the same server, the item can be set to `http://localhost:9090`. The value can be configured by the actual deployment or set to the public Side node which provides the gRPC server.

#### 4. Set the Bitcoin RPC
```
[bitcoin]
network = "<network name>"
rpc = "<rpc endpoint>"
user = "<rpc username>"
password = "<rpc password>"
```

For signers and relayers, the bitcoin node rpc is required to send the signed transactions or sync the bitcoin block headers and the bridge related transactions to the Side chain.
In the Side testnet phase 3, the corresponding bitcoin network is `testnet3`. For testnet3, the network name is `testnet` and defaut port is `18332`.
The TSS node operator can deploy own bitcoin node or use the third-party server provider by demand.
The public bitcoin node information provided by Side Labs is as follows:
```
network = "testnet"
rpc = "http://192.248.150.102:18332"
user = "side"
password = "12345678"
```
**_Note_**: The `--txindex` is required to be set when starting the Bitcoin node as following:

```
bitcoind -txindex -rpcuser=<user> --rpcpassword=<password>
```

### Fund the relayer address
The relayer(Side transaction sender) address can be viewed by the following command:
```
shuttler --home <home> address
```
**Note**: Before starting the TSS node, the relayer address needs to be funded for sending the transactions to the Side chain.

### Submit your tss pubkey to us

#### 1. Get your tss pubkey
```sh
vi .shuttler/priv_validator_key.json
```
Get your tss pubkey value.

#### 2. Submit pubkey to us
TSS info:
```
tss name: <your node moniker>
tss pubkey: <pubkey>
```
Submit the above information in the TG group "Side Protocol Signer Set" and tag @shaneqiu.

### Waiting for proposal to be submitted and participate in voting

#### 1. Proposal
We will submit a proposal to add TSS network whitelist.

#### 2. Voting
Please wait for the above proposal and vote.

#### 3. Waiting for the proposal to be approved.

### Start TSSigner

#### Start
After waiting for the above proposal to be passed, execute the following command to run the TSS node.
```
shuttler --home <home> start --bridge --lending
```
